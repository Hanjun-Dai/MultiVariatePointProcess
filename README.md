PtPack is a C++ software library for learning and making inference from high-dimensional point processes. This package provides a basic implementation of our proposed framework for fitting and assessing general large-scale multivariate point processes with different structure constraints, including: sparse structure, group sparse structure, low-rank structure, etc. In addition to the standard simulation task, it also supports the various inference algorithms proposed in the thesis, such as scalable inference estimation and maximization, time-sensitive recommendation, shaping user activities.
